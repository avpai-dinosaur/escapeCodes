	To: Tobey, Rushabh, An
	From: Shawn
	Timestamp: Monday 9:12AM
	Hey Team! 

I just wanted to say THANK YOU ALL for making my first week amazing! So far, I’ve shadowed several different teams, sat in on a strategy call, and Rushabh even gave me a walkthrough of the amenities/buffet system (legendary 🍪).

Also fun fact: Did you know that the floor we’re on has 4 vending machines??? I’ve tried snacks from most of them already! 

Can’t wait to get my name on the employee leaderboard (currently sitting at...well, unranked 😂).

Tobey: 
Rushabh, I swear if one more exec pings me about those Q2 deliverables, I might move my desk into the supply closet permanently. 

Rushabh:
Hang in there, man. Remember what HR said during orientation: “Mental clarity comes whenever you least expect it.” 😂 As if that’s helpful.

Tobey:
I haven’t had mental clarity since 2030. 
I counted— 7 execs emailed me just this morning. 
I just finished my second meeting– have another in a few minutes, with An, which is terrifying. 

Rushabh:
Oh, I feel you. Lmk how I can help (except the meeting with An- I cherish my life too much). You’ve got this!

Tobey: 
Thanks :/

Hello, 

Please find below a minor behavioral concern for review:

During today’s afternoon synced work-time, a gif of a cat slapping a dog was posted in the #general channel by Tobey. This was followed by an ambiguous emoji reaction (“🥴”) from Rushabh and a laughing emoji from Shawn. 

While I appreciate humor, we must always consider appropriateness and our company’s anti-violence mission. This is the third message that I have personally flagged this week for tone. 

In my role as supervisor, I’ve reviewed Shawn’s onboarding documentation, including his workplace readiness agreement with HR. (Which, he “accidentally” left unsigned for 2 days.) Understand that we value promptness at WeX. 

Warmly, 
An</property>

Show Shawn the “break room” (supply closet, we go there to cool off sometimes)
Avoid siding with anyone in the An situation: stay neutral!! 😬

On a gameshow, the contestant is on the verge of winning a million dollars. But he is shown 3 boxes for his last question. 

One has the number 5134
One has the number 7287
One has the number 9418 

But each box has a label printed on it. 

Box A says “This box contains Number 7287”

Box B says “this box does not contain the number 5134”

Box C says “Box A is lying”

Only one of the labels is stating the truth. Find the number in Box B
